INSTALLATION

    To install this module, cd to the directory that contains this INSTALL file
    and type the following:

        perl Makefile.PL
        nmake
        nmake test
        nmake install

    Use "dmake" rather than "nmake" in the commands above if that is what your
    Perl was built with.  To determine which make program was used to build your
    Perl type the following:

        perl -V:make

    Note that you should try to use the same compiler to build this module as
    was used to build your Perl itself.

    In particular, linking against the msvcrt.lib import library that comes with
    recent versions of the Microsoft Visual C++ compiler (version 7 and above)
    now produces binaries that depend on compiler-specific DLL's named
    msvcr70.dll, msvcr71.dll, etc, rather than the OS's msvcrt.dll.  This module
    may not work correctly if you build it with a different compiler than was
    used to build your Perl such that two different C runtime DLL's get loaded.

PREREQUISITES

    This module is only applicable on "native" (i.e. non-Cygwin) Microsoft
    Windows platforms since only those platforms have C runtime libraries that
    suffer the behaviour which this module provides corrections to.

    Perl version 5.6.0 or later.

    There are no non-standard Perl modules required by this module.
