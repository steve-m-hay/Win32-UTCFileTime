
Win32::UTCFileTime version 1.10
===============================

NAME

	Win32::UTCFileTime - Get/set UTC file times with stat/utime on Win32

SYNOPSIS

	# Override built-in stat()/lstat()/utime() within current package only:
	use Win32::UTCFileTime;
	@stats = stat $file or die "stat() failed: $^E\n";
	$now = time;
	utime $now, $now, $file;

	# Or, override built-in stat()/lstat()/utime() within all packages:
	use Win32::UTCFileTime qw(:globally);
	...

DESCRIPTION

	This module provides replacements for Perl's built-in stat() and utime()
	functions which respectively get and set "correct" UTC file times, instead
	of the erroneous values read and written by Microsoft's implementation of
	stat(2) and utime(2) which Perl's built-in functions inherit on Win32 when
	built with the Microsoft C library.

INSTALLATION

	To install this module type the following:

		perl Makefile.PL
		nmake
		nmake test
		nmake install

DEPENDENCIES

	There are no non-standard modules required by this module.

	This module is only applicable on Microsoft Windows platforms when using a
	Perl built using Microsoft Visual C since other C build environments do not
	(presumably) suffer the Microsoft-specific behaviour which this module
	provides corrections to.
