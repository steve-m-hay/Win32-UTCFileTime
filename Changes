                        Win32::UTCFileTime, Version 1.30
________________________________________________________________________________

Revision history for Perl extension Win32::UTCFileTime.
_________________

v1.30 22 Feb 2004

    - Changed stat(), lstat() and alt_stat() to use $_ if no argument is given,
      as per the Perl built-in functions.

    - Added new test program to exercise this new feature.

    - Clarified licence and warranty for the module, and included relevant
      licence files in the distribution.

    - Moved installation instructions to a separate INSTALL file.

    - Added PREOP to the dist option in Makefile.PL to ensure permissions are
      set correctly within the distdir (since they often aren't set correctly in
      the top-level directory when working on Windows) to stop CPANTS from
      complaining about bad permissions.

    - Added COMPRESS (and SUFFIX) and ZIPFLAGS to the dist option in Makefile.PL
      to enable "best compression" for gzip when running "nmake dist" and for
      zip when running "nmake zipdist" respectively.

    - Added clean option to Makefile.PL to have the const-c.inc and const-xs.inc
      files deleted by "nmake clean".

    - Added MANIFEST.SKIP to stop "nmake distcheck" from producing bogus
      warnings.

    - Moved SharedFileOpen.pm into lib/Win32/ sub-directory within distribution.
      This is the new layout style produced by h2xs as of version 1.23.

    - Removed ppport.h since no use was being made of it.  (This module builds
      on Perl installations back to 5.6.0, both with and without ithreads,
      without needing any portability fixups.)
_________________

v1.20 24 Sep 2003

    - Introduced an alternative C stat(2) function from CVSNT and Perl code that
      can succeed in some cases where Microsoft's implementation fails.  A Perl
      interface, alt_stat(), is optionally exported, and can be automatically
      tried by the replacement stat() and lstat() functions if the built-in
      functions that they call first fail.

    - Changed the replacement utime()'s use of Perl's trick for making it work
      on directories too.  The trick only works under Windows NT platforms, so
      it is more appropriate to try a more natural approach first and only fall
      back on the trick if that fails.  This is the approach that Perl uses too.

    - Improved the replacement stat() and lstat() functions by having them fall
      back on CreateFile() if FindFirstFile() fails when getting the correct UTC
      file times.  The file times can now be retrieved under Windows NT
      platforms for root (drive or UNC) directories, and for directories
      specified with a trailing slash or backslash.

    - Improved the detection of the filesystem when determining whether or not
      it stores UTC file times.

    - Cached the conversion of the base SYSTEMTIME to FILETIME for a minor
      speed-up.

    - Changed the output of debug information to use warn() rather than simply
      print()'ing to STDERR to enable the information to be captured by a
      $SIG{__WARN__} handler if required.

    - Added new test programs to exercise the new and improved features.

    - Renamed some functions in the XS and C code.

    - Reverted the typemap for "const char *" back to the default T_PV.  There
      didn't seem to be any point in the custom typemap.

    - Changed tabs to spaces (via "expand -t 4 infile > outfile") to avoid
      irritation when switching between editors that use 4- or 8-space tabs.

    - Added META.yml (courtesy of ExtUtils::MakeMaker 6.17).

v1.10 23 Jun 2003

    - Incorporated improvements to the underlying C code from CVSNT code.  The
      DST season transition dates are now correctly calculated (assuming that
      they are not determined by year-specific clues), rather than assuming the
      United States' rule applies.
